DESCRIPTION ABOUT PREDATOR PREY MODEL SIMULATION :
THE PREDATOR-PREY MODEL SIMULATES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PREDATOR AND PREY POPULATIONS IN AN ECOSYSTEM. IT SHOWS HOW PREY POPULATIONS GROW, LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN PREDATORS, WHICH THEN REDUCES PREY NUMBERS. AS PREY DECLINE, PREDATOR POPULATIONS ALSO DECREASE, CREATING A CYCLICAL PATTERN. THIS HELPS STUDY POPULATION DYNAMICS, ECOSYSTEM BALANCE, AND SPECIES INTERACTIONS.

TOOLS USED IN THIS :
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: PYTHON (WITH LIBRARIES LIKE NUMPY, SCIPY, AND MATPLOTLIB) OR R FOR WRITING THE EQUATIONS AND CREATING VISUALIZATIONS.

REQUIREMENTS :
Programming language: Python, R, or MATLAB for calculations and visualization.
EXDECUTION AND DATASET :
 data set for predator-prey simulation typically includes:

Time Steps: Time intervals (e.g., days, years) over which the simulation runs.
Prey Population: Number of prey individuals at each time step.
Predator Population: Number of predator individuals at each time step.
Prey Birth Rate: Rate at which prey reproduce.
Predator Death Rate: Rate at which predators die due to natural causes.
Predation Rate: Rate at which predators hunt prey.
Predator Reproduction Rate: Rate at which predators reproduce, based on available prey.
Carrying Capacity: The maximum population size that the environment can support for both predators and prey.
VISUALIZATIONS :
Population Graphs: Plotting predator and prey populations over time to show cyclical changes.
Phase Plot: A graph showing the relationship between predator and prey populations.
Time Series: Line graphs displaying changes in population sizes at different time steps.
Heatmaps: Visualizing the spatial distribution of predator and prey in agent-based models


TOTAL ABUNDANCE : 
Total Abundance refers to the combined population of both predators and prey in a simulation at any given time. It is the sum of the number of predators and prey and is used to measure the overall population density in the ecosystem. In a predator-prey model, total abundance can help assess the health and stability of the ecosystem, showing the effect of interactions on population sizes over time.
